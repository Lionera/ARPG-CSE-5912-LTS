Oh, you actually did it.

Wow... 

Keep this between you and me...

I may need to go... Investigate... To see what exactly that blue dragon has taken...

Anyways, great work!

Go ahead and enter the tomb. But be warned: It's full of dangerous enemies...

... Stronger than the ruins of Yeager.

Good luck!
