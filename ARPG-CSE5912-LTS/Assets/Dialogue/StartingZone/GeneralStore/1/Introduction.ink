Welcome to Blightlin! You'll wish you never arrived. 
These damned undead are neverending... So many of our people have fallen... 
What..? 
You wish to help us? 
Well, then I guess you are quite brave... 
Or just very ignorant. 
Regardless, my name is Mary. I sell wares that may prove useful to you. Potions, scrolls, so on so forth. 
Just make sure you are prepared once you leave our town.
